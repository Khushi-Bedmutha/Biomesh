# Biomesh

Biomesh is a **decentralized AI-powered human body data network**. It is designed to securely collect, store, and process medical and biometric data using **blockchain and AI technologies**. The goal is to create a **trustless and transparent system** where users have full control over their data while enabling advanced **medical research, AI-driven diagnostics, and secure data sharing**.

## Tech Stack

Biomesh is built using modern web technologies:

- **Frontend:** React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Blockchain & Storage:** Pinata IPFS for decentralized file storage
- **AI & Data Processing:** AI models for medical data analysis
- **Tools & Configurations:** ESLint, TypeScript, PostCSS, Vite

## Cloning the Repository

To set up the project locally, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sarthak2477/Biomesh.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Biomesh
```

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary packages for the backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Backend Server**: Launch the backend server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

## Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that all frontend dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server**: Run the frontend server using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   By default, the frontend development server runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Running Both Frontend and Backend

To run both the frontend and backend simultaneously, follow the steps above in separate terminal instances. Ensure that both servers are active to allow full functionality of the application.
